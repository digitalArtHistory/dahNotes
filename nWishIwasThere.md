## Workshops

### A place for Places: Current Trends and Challenges in the Development and Use of Geo-Historical Gazetteers

PreL01

The proposed full day workshop aims to investigate the latest developments of geo-historical gazetteers and their impact in natural language processing and digital humanities studies. In particular the workshop will deal with crucial problems concerning the geo-spatial models of representation for ancient places, and the management of temporal information for geographic features in general. Current projects concerning the publication of geo-historical data as Linked Open Data, as well as their exploitation for annotating and enriching texts will also be discussed, alongside with more theoretical issues on vocabularies and ontologies. A group of well known invited scholars will hold 15 minutes presentations, discussing different and approaches to the topic, ranging from engineering, data models, standards and publication, corpus annotation models, visualization. Finally, an interactive discussion with workshop attendees as well as a sum up panel will constitute an occasion for the community to gather together and harmonize efforts.

### From Digitization to Knowledge: Resources and Methods for Semantic Processing of Digital Works/Texts

The goal of this workshop is twofold: First, provide a venue for researchers to describe and discuss practical methods and tools used in the construction of semantically annotated text collections. We expect such tools to include lexical and semantic resources with a focus on the interlinking of concepts and entities and their integration into corpora.
A second goal is to report on the on-going development of new tools for providing access to the rich information contained in large text collections. Semantic tools and resources are reaching a quality that makes them fit for building practical applications. They include ontologies, framenets, syntactic and semantic parsers, entity linkers, etc. We are interested in examples of cases that make use of such tools and their evaluation in the field of digital humanities with a specific interest on multilingual and cross-lingual aspects of semantic processing of text.

### Biographical Data Workshop: modeling, sharing and analyzing people’s lives

PreL03

Fokkens, Antske (1); Wandl-Vogt, Eveline (2); Declerck, Thierry (3); ter Braake, Serge (4); Hyvönen, Eero (5); Bosse, Arno (6)

1: VU University, Netherlands, The; 2: Austrian Academy of Sciences, Austria; 3: German Research Center for Artificial intelligence, Germany; 4: University of Amsterdams, Netherlands, The; 5: Aalto University, Finland; 6: Oxford University, United Kingdom, The
This workshop brings together researchers from various domains working on biographical data. In addition to sharing latest progress, it has the specific aim to initiate efforts to share (knowledge about) data and data models. The workshop directly contributes to the efforts of the DARIAH workgroup on biographical data and aims to involve new researchers in this collaboration. The workshop consist of two main components: dedicated sessions about data and data models followed by a discussion on this topic and a poster session where researchers can share their latest work on biographical data and computational analysis. Descriptions on data models and data samples will be distributed to participants in advance and studied by a panel. The panel will present their findings and support the discussion on sharing data. Direct involvement in several projects and strong relations with other international partners guarantees an interesting set of data and data models.

### Minimal Computing: A Workshop

PreFS23

We use “minimal computing” to refer to computing done under some set of significant constraints, including constraints of hardware, software, education, network capacity, infrastructure, and power. Minimal computing is also used to capture the maintenance, refurbishing, and use of machines to do digital humanities work out of necessity, along with the choice to use new, streamlined computing hardware, such as Raspberry Pi or Arduino. While minimal computing has gained traction in various fields, it remains largely unexplored by digital humanities practitioners. Additionally, conversations about minimal computing become opportunities to discuss and share the material conditions in which digital humanities research is being conducted. We are proposing a single, full-day workshop at Digital Humanities 2016. This workshop will explore the practice and influence of minimal computing from both a practical and theoretical perspective

### Ontology-Based Recording and Discovery of Research Patterns in the Humanities

PreL04

Constantopoulos, Panos (1,2); Dallas, Costis (2,3); Hughes, Lorna (4); Ross, Seamus (1,3,4)
1: Athens University of Economics and Business, Greece; 2: Digital Curation Unit / IMIS – Athena Research Centre; 3: University of Toronto; 4: University of Glasgow

This workshop aims to engage participants in the process of developing and analyzing ontology-based, structured documentations of scholarly research practices, predominantly those in the (digital) humanities. The workshop will employ NeMO, the ontology for digital research methods in the arts and humanities developed in the context of the NeDiMAH project. Participants will be invited to contribute one or more examples of their own research work, from which they will produce structured descriptions according to NeMO, to explore the formulation of complex associative queries that aim at discovering patterns of work or resource usage and to share feedback regarding their experience from using NeMO.

### Topogram: a Web Toolkit for Spatio-Temporal Network Mapping

PreH21

Topogram is an open-source web toolkit to map social, semantic and spatio-temporal dynamics from large sets of data. It answers the growing need for interactive mapping of complex online and offline interactions. The methodological concept of topogram provides ways to represent and explore relationships in data by considering different dimensions : words (lexical analysis), relationships (networks), time (changes and evolution) and space (maps). The software is divided into 2 parts : 1) a Python mining library to extract and format networks of words, citations and places from text data and 2) a collaborative web interface to visualize, edit, annotate and publish graphs. During this workshop, we will introduce Topogram from installation to the publishing of annotated graphs online from raw sets of data (typically from online social networks, sensors or machine logs).
